# ToffoliChallenge_FallFestQiskit_Pennylane
Challenge from Pennylane provided on the Fall Fest Qiskit.

It is known that by working with the CNOT gate and unitary gates we can build any other type of gates. One of the important challenges of quantum computing is to build the Toffoli gate from these. Reading an old work we have found the following equivalence:

Unfortunately, the parameters of the U3 gate have deteriorated and we cannot remember their value. Could you calculate these values?
